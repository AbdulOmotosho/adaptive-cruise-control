<h1>Adaptive Cruise Control System</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>

<p>
    Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is a complex driving assistance system that builds upon the existing Cruise Control system found in many modern vehicles. A case study on process control problems used Cruise Control as the focus and that provided the idea to expand on the present system. The current Cruise Control system maintains the driver’s speed at a set target, and it will speed up or slow down the car to maintain this target regardless of any conditions on the route.
</p>

<p>
    This system automatically adapts the vehicle’s speed based on a variety of external factors present on the roadway. The ACC system uses several sensors to achieve this and monitors the vehicles in front of it within its range as well as environmental conditions or hazards to maintain a safe distance for the driver. As a result, driving comfort and safety will increase to a greater extent than the contemporary Cruise Control System.
</p>

<p>
    The objective of this project is to design a software architecture for an ACC system that will combine multiple functional components to work together towards one goal. These components are the initial Cruise Control System, a hazard detection system, a distance monitoring system, a comprehensive driver display, and fault handling for safety. This design will emphasize modularity, environmentally driven outputs, and excellent fault tolerance. As a result, a hybrid system architecture that uses both feedback control loops and precise algorithms will be built to satisfy all use cases as well as functional and nonfunctional requirements.
