    <h1>Adaptive Cruise Control System</h1>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>The ACC system demonstrates how process-control principles and quality-driven software architecture can yield a robust, human-centered automotive design. By combining a human-centered design with the rigorous architectural reasoning and rationale, the team was able to achieve a resulting system that balances innovation, reliability, as well as practicality. Beginning from the adaptive cruise control case study, the team was able to extend it to a dynamic, sensory-based control using a modular hybrid architecture mapped directly to the FR and NFRs. The overall system design offers high-quality software that is consistent with software quality and design attributes and goals</p>
